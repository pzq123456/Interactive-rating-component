## Overview
In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a rating component that would allow users to select a rating and submit it. The component would then display a "Thank you" card with the user's rating.
* I used Vue 3 framework to create this component.

> This is my first time using Vue 3 and I'm still learning it. I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but this is what I came up with.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to use Vue 3 to create a component. I also learned how to use the `v-model` directive to create a two-way binding between the component and the parent component. I also learned how to use the `v-if` directive to conditionally render elements.
